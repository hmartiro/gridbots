# test new software that incorporates primitive commands and
# support operations into simultaneous sequences

# test if sequences of zmoves have necessary delay between moves
# the idea is to try one of the alternatives and examing the generated timeline

#echo test primitive moves

#simscript (zmove (1, 0, 4), zmove (2, 0, 4))

# try with only scripts
echo test sub-ordinate scripts
simscript (sim_z1, sim_z2)

# try mixing scripts and primitives
#echo test sub-ordinate scripts with primitive
#simscript (sim_z1, sim_z2, zmove (3, 8, 0))
